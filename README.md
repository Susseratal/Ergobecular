## The Ergobecular  
The Ergobecular is a custom open source keyboard design based partly on the Ergodox EZ and partly on things like the Ferris Sweep or the Gergoplex.  
It's a low profile, programmable keyboard which is designed to be made, customised, tweaked and shared.  
The initial design will be designed for Kailh Choc low profile switches and will include a keymap designed for my layout, a screen for information, and a custom ZMK fork.  
All of this will be included in it's entirety for you to do with as you please.  
I hope you enjoy my mad behaviour and enjoy the keyboard
