# Keyboard Firmware

## Ergobecular  
These two repositories will both contain all the PCB and 3D printing files needed to make your own Ergobecular with either the Cherry MX pinout, or the Kailh Choc Low profile pinout.  
Each of them will contain more detailed documentation, but the important thing to note is that the firmware between the two should be completely identical, and I may even just make it a separate directory to avoid any inconsistencies.  
Either way, I haven't made the thing yet, but it'll be here when I do. 

## Ergodox firmware  
This is the firmware that's actually completed, and the ergobecular will be very similar, but more minimal.  
The Ergodox firmware contains both the source and a compiled hex file for my Ergodox layout. I have made some tweaks and compiled from source, which is why I include the files rather than just dropping a link to the Oryx page.  
My Ergodox is the Shine variant, so if you have the Glow or non LED variants, it might be prudent to download the necessary firmware and do a diff to see where changes need to be made. 

Do let me know what you think of the keyboards when they're done and what you think of the layouts I've written for them because I'd be very interested to know if anyone else can actually use them.
